## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 4, part 1

    This lab is one of my favorite labs because we learned about units of measurement. In this lab, we had to 
    convert a measurement of volume from milliliters in the metric system to various units in the US customary
    system (teaspoons, tablespoons, ounces, and cups). I use different units of measurement all the time, so 
    learning how to code a converter was very entertaining. I am very interested in cooking and baking, and 
    since some recipes use different units, coding this lab was enjoyable, knowing I could learn how to convert 
    them. 

* Lab 9, part 1

    This lab was very fun to do since we created a spell checker program. Spell-checker programs are beneficial,
    in my opinion, and seem like they would be fun to use. In this lab, we used vectors and strings to store 
    words in the dictionary; it was a little challenging but fun overall. I enjoyed coding something that 
    can be useful, and I also used it to write this portfolio. 

* Lab 8, part 2

    This lab taught us how to use patterns with loops, which was very interesting to learn. We made a pattern 
    to create a number of operations that repeat over and over again. While this pattern can't be used for 
    knitting since it's simpler, it was still good practice to later create patterns that could be used for 
    knitting. I like knitting, which is why this seems like an exciting idea. Coding this lab was fun for me 
    since I knew I could use those skills to create a pattern to knit someday.
